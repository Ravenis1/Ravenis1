- 👋 Hi, I’m Rav. I'm over 40 years old and this is my GitHub account.
- 👀 I’m interested in computer related things, since a kid, when I saw my neighbour playing commodore 64.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding, almost 35 years of it, and I'm still learning new things every day, you can't reach the end in this. I'm skilled on all fields what comes to computers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone, who is needing help, or is as cool and nerd as I am.
- 📫 You can reach me here.
- 💡 In coding, there is no impossible, if you think there is, then there is.
- 😁 Fun fact ^
